## Rubric
- **Executive Summary**
    - “An executive summary, sometimes known as a management summary, is a short document or section of a document, produced for business purposes, that summarizes a longer report or proposal or a group of related reports in such a way that readers can rapidly become acquainted with a large body of material without having to read it all. ” – Wikipedia

- **Issues Identified**
     - Consider if issues are appropriately identified as good or poor usability (considering our analysis in Monday's class). Specific issues should be included for the aspects of learnability, efficiency, memorability and error rate. Satisfaction can be viewed as how well the user interface helps users reach their goals, and also the summation of the other four aspects of usability.

- **Relevant Examples**
    - Consider if the user interface examples chosen (for both poor and good usability) are well related to the issue(s) they are associated with, and if they also support the issue(s) in question.

- **Clarity (incl. writing and grammar)**
    - Consider overall flow of text, writing style, and grammar.

- **Overall Presentation**
    - Consider the overall visual presentation of the assignment, including organization.
